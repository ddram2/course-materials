## Association between PFAS exposure and thyroid function

We investigated the association between serum PFAS concentrations and thyroid hormone levels among 3,245 Korean adults from the KoNEHS cycle 4. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, smoking status and alcohol consumption, we founded that PFOS concentration in the highest quartile was found to be significantly associated with elevated TSH level (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.12–1.88) compared to those in the lowest quartile.

Furthermore, PFOA showed negative association with free T4 (β = -0.12, p < 0.05). This associations were more pronounce in female participants. Specifically, woman in the highest PFOA quartile had 23% lower free T4 levels then those in the lowest quartile (p for trend = 0.003).

Our finding suggest that exposure to PFAS, particularly PFOS and PFOA, may disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis, with potentially stronger effect in womans. It is worth noting that these results are consistent to previous studies conducted in European and North American populations due to the fact that PFAS are ubiquitous environmental contaminants.
